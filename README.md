# Project Connect App

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

The goal of this project is to crowdsource and gamify the validation of geolocation data for schools around the world. We need as much help as we can get by looking at satellite imagery at predefined GPS coordinates, and corroborate whether what the user is seeing could be a school or not.

This effort is framed within [Project Connect](https://www.projectconnect.world/), run by the [UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/),  with the goal of knowing where schools are and how connected they are to inform programs around education, health and emergencies. Project Connect emerged out of a need that was expressed by many UNICEF partners and UNICEF Country Offices.

## ðŸŽ® App

The app was live online between 2020 and 2022, but it is no longer available online. It was played 240,000 times by about 800 different people through a small number of corporate partnership programs. It was never released to the general public. 

Refer to the [game code repository](https://github.com/lacabra/proco-map-app) for the actual code.

## ðŸ“‚ Roadmap

* **[Gamification](docs/gamification.md)**: Idea exploration to further improve the user experience.

* **Incentivization**: Building financial and non-financial incentives as outlined in [unicef/incentives](https://github.com/unicef/incentives), with a possible blockchain component.

* **Integration**: Integration with other mapping tools from [Project Connect](https://projectconnect.world), which involve two separate workstreams in the backend and in the frontend.
